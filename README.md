# Speaking-app
I builded this app basically for text listing in 2018 but now i am uplaoded in github in 2021.
If somebody not want to read text and he wants to listen, so they will put the entire text in that input section and then app will speak the entire text through cortana or jarvish and this text file only support in windows system.
